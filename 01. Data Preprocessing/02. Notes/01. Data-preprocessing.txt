Machine Learning proccess

1. Data preproccesing 
- Import Data
- Clean Data
- Split into training & test sets (20% test 80% tarining)

2. Modelling
- Build Model
- Train Model
- Make Prediction

3. Evaluation
- Make a verdict
- Calculate perdormace metrics

Training and test sets

Feature scalling - apply with column
1. Normalization - (X - Xmin) / (Xmax - Xmin)
2. Standardization - (X - Xaverage) / (Standard deviation)

Always scale features that are comparable
- Normalization
- Standardization

features - information that may help to solve prediction
dependent variable - the information variable what we want to solve
