### Linear Regression 
**`Simple Linear regression`** is best used when the feature (independent variable) has a linearity relationship with its dependent variable *(the variable we want to predict)*. 

To check whether a feature has a linear relationship, it is best to scatter them in x and y plane. where `x axis` represent the feature and `y axis` represent the variable we want to predict. This also applies witih other models such as **`Multiple Linear regression`**

#### Assumptions in Linear regression
- **Linearity** - linear relationships between feature and dependent variable.
- **Homoscedasticity** - Equal variance
- **Multi variate normality** - normality of error distribution
- **Independence** - Each residual should not be related to other residuals in the dataset. 
- **Lack of multicolinearity** - avoid high colinearity between features in multiple `linear regression`
- **outllier check** - make sure there is no extreme data values
